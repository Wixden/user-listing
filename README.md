# Firebase CRUD Operations with React

This project demonstrates Firebase's capabilities for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations in a React application. It serves as a practical example of managing user data using Firebase's real-time database.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new user data, including name, email, and additional information.

- **Read:** Retrieve and display user data from the Firebase database in a user-friendly interface.

- **Update:** Edit and update user information, keeping the database synchronized.

- **Delete:** Remove user records from the database while maintaining data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The front-end of this project is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Firebase is used to store and manage user data, offering real-time synchronization across all connected clients.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/firebase-crud-react.git

   Navigate to the project directory:
   cd firebase-crud-react

   Install dependencies
   npm install

   Create a Firebase project and set up a Firebase Realtime Database. Update your Firebase configuration in the project.
   
   Start the development server:
   npm start

   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the CRUD application.
